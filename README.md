# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment;
and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop
new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. Earthquake data is updated every 5 minutes by USGS.

### EarthQuake Map Visualization

* Created an earthquake map using Leaflet and earthquakes data from USGS website.
* Map based on earthquake magnitude and their longitude and latitude.
* Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color.
* Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
* Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
* Created three different map layers (dark, outdoor and satallite) for great visualization experience.
* Create a legend that will provide context for map data.
* Plot a second data set on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
